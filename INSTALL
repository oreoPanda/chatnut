Installation Instructions for Windows

chatnut does not require any installation. Simply run chatnut.exe, which
is located in the exe folder.
If you wish, you can create a shortcut on your desktop referring to
chatnut.exe in the exe folder.

In case you want to compile chatnut on your machine, you can use the Makefile
in this directory. It assumes that you're using gcc as compiler, if you're not, 
change the Makefile accordingly.

If your make program is called make, you can run the command

'make'

in this directory to build chatnut. If your make program has a different
name, use that name.

After building, you can optionally run the command

'make clean'

to remove all object files in ./src.

Feel free to contact the developer with any questions about installation
or compiling.
