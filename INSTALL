Installation Instructions for Windows

chatnut does not require any installation. Simply double-click on chatnut.exe, 
which is a shortcut to chatnut.exe in the bin folder, to run chatnut.
If you wish, you can create a shortcut on your desktop referring to chatnut.exe.

In case you want to compile chatnut on your machine, you can use the Makefile
in this directory. It assumes that you're using gcc as compiler, if you're not, 
change the Makefile accordingly.

If your make program is called make, you can run the command

'make'

in this directory to build chatnut. If your make program has a different
name, use that name.

After building, you can optionally run the command

'make clean'

to remove all object files in ./src.

Feel free to contact the developer with any questions about installation
or compiling.
